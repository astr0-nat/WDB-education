    <h4> Fictional Character Biography</h4>
    <p> Larry David stars as a fictional version of himself, in which he is still the co-creator and co-writer of the 90's hit comedy sitcom
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>. He lives a married life for the majority of the series, and finds himself a bachelor running a spite store 
        in later seasons. 
    </p>
    <h4> Synopsis </h4>
    <p>Larry mentions in the series that the character <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Costanza">George Costanza</a> in Seinfeld was written 
        and created in the image of himself. This alone accurately describes Larry's portrail in Curb Your Enthusiasm. The sheer
        authenticity and realness of Larry David, which contributes to his gold-standard humor and writing ability, is precisely 
        what gets him into trouble in each episode. The title of the series reflects Larry's belief that many of the people around him
        are putting on airs, and that the social norms and nicities encourage a false enthusiasm for stuff that Larry deams ridiculous.
        Episodes usually involve Larry refusing to follow such norms and interacting with the backlash, or Larry loudly imposing his own 
        norms and interacting with the backlash. </p>
